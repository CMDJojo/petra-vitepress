# About us

The PETRA group &ndash;
the Primary care Emergent Technology Research and Advancement Group &ndash;
is a research group started by a group of students, physiciants, and
Ph.D. students from Sweden, all with a strong interest in research, new
technology, and healthcare. We have since expanded, adding collaborations with
more researchers from Sweden and from abroad. Learn more about the team behind
PETRA [here](The%20team).

## Our mission

The purpose of the PETRA group is to evaluate emergent technology in primary
care, and promote its implementation in a way that benefits society.

## Reach out!

We strongly believe collaboration and joint effort
makes the research community stronger. Since our focus is on new and emergent
technology, collaboration is vital to keep up with the pace of innovation.
If you want to be a part of future research projects, or even have an idea
yourself about a possible future project and/or publication, feel free to
reach out to us!
