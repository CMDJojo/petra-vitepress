# The team

The PETRA research group is a group that takes pride in collaborating with
all and any researches which contributes to research within our area of
focus. This means that we have many collaborations, and thus many members,
of the PETRA group, some of which who works with us for a while on one or
a couple of projects, and some of which who are a part of multiple projects.

## Board of PETRA

The "Board of PETRA", if we can call it that, are the members who control the
PETRA organization itself. Most of the people here have a strong engagement
in multiple of the projects, but more essentially, they governs the PETRA
group and make organization-level decisions.
_The members are listed in alphabetic order._
