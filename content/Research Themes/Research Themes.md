# Research Themes 

To streamline and direct research progression, the projects of the group is organized under five overarching themes. Here follows a short explanations of each theme. 

_Theme One: AI-benchmark for Swedish Primary Care_
Several non-representative databases (such as the USMLE) has been used previously to test the capabilities of AI-models in healthcare. Our aim with the development of the benchmark for Swedish primary care is to create a representative benchmark. The goal is to develop publically availiable benchmarks, accessible to developers and reseachers all over the world. The benchmarks will be developed in the three stages, with increasing levels of complexity:
- Oracle AI 
- EHR-embedded active assistant
- EHR-embedded agentic AI

_Theme Two: Evaluation of AI-models_ 
A broad theme, comprising different was of evaluating current technology as applied to healthcare. This invloves the previously pulished BJM article from december 2024. It may contain evaluations such as:
- Evaluation of performance of exams 
- Evaluation of performance on specifically designed benchmarks (such as our own)
- Qualitative studies 
- Clinical studies 

_Theme Three: Development_
In the design of benchmarks, value, usability and creation of applications has to be taken into account. There are several opportunities to develop tools to aid clinicians, spuring out of the conduction of reseach from the PETRA-group. 

_Theme Four: Data creation, methods and tools_
Technical tools, methods and datasets are crucial to enable progress of AI-research within healthcare. Currenlty, two major projects are part of this theme:
- Development of Synthetic Electronic Health Records
- Development and iteration of LLM-based automated correction algorithms

_Theme Five: Medical philosophy and stakeholder preferences_ 
The increasing capabilities of AI raise questions relating to the value and function of human clinicians. This is partly a philosophical questions, but perhaps even more a question of human preference. We dive deep into this question from different angles. 
- Philosophical inquiry into the value of human clinicians
- Survey study researching the preferences of patients
- Interview studies, evaluating patient and clinician preferences
