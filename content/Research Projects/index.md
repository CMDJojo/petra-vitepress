# Our research

This group actively conducts research in several topics. Since we have many projects
ongoing at the same time, not all members of the group are part of every project,
and we invite and collaborate with different researches outside the group in projects
we deem to align with our purpose as a group, to facilitate a broad and well-established
foundation for policymakers and healthcare units to rely on.

### ChatGPT (GPT-4) versus doctors on complex cases of the Swedish family medicine specialist examination: an observational comparative study

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as GPT-4, have shown promise in answering medical multiple-choice questions. However, how well can AI handle free-text assessments for complex primary care cases? This study compared GPT-4's responses to those of real doctors using anonymized cases from the Swedish family medicine specialist examination. While GPT-4 achieved a mean score of 4.5 on a 10-point scale, it fell short of both randomly selected doctor responses (6.0) and top-tier doctor responses (7.2). This underscores the current limitations of AI in nuanced medical decision-making. Read the [full article here](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/12/e086148).

## Ongoing research

- The [**Survey study**](Survey%20study), **"AI Entering Healthcare: What Requirements Should We Set?"**,
  conducts a survey among clinicians and the general public
  to better understand how accurate artificial intelligence tools must be for them to be
  used in a healthcare setting, as well as who bears the responsibility for errors that
  occurs as a result from the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare.
- The [**Perspective Methasynthesis**](Perspective%20metasynthesis) project aims to synthesize
  current qualitative research on the perspectives of clinicians and patients on artificial
  intelligence in primary care settings.
- The [**Question study**](Question%20study), **"Can AI Address Primary Care's Knowledge
  Requirements? A Study of Clinically Relevant Questions"**, aims to categorize and quantify
  the types of questions that doctors and nurses in Swedish primary care might ask a medical
  chatbot. The collected questions will inform future studies, including benchmarking AI
  performance in answering medical queries, comparing AI-generated responses to human expertise,
  and creating datasets for training and evaluating medical chatbots in a Swedish healthcare
  context.
- The [**Qualitative study**](Qualitative%20study), **"Perceptions and Attitudes Toward AI
  as a Tool in Primary Care"**, explores perceptions and attitudes toward the use of AI,
  particularly large language models, in Swedish primary care as clinical decision support
  tools for healthcare professionals or direct interfaces for patients. Through qualitative
  interviews, it aims to identify key themes and patterns to guide the implementation and
  development of AI in healthcare.
- The [**Synthetic EHR study**](Synthetic%20EHR%20study), **"Creating an Open, Synthetic
  Medical Record Dataset in Swedish for AI Development in Healthcare"**, aims to create an open
  dataset of synthetic medical records in Swedish, mimicking the language and structure of
  real patient records while ensuring complete anonymization. The dataset will support AI
  development in healthcare by providing realistic training data for language processing tasks.
