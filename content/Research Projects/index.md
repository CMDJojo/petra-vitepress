# Our research

This group actively conducts research in several topics. Since we have many projects
ongoing at the same time, not all members of the group are part of every project,
and we invite and collaborate with different researches outside the group in projects
we deem to align with our purpose as a group, to facilitate a broad and well-established
foundation for policymakers and healthcare units to rely on.

## Ongoing research

- The [**survey**](Survey) project conducts a survey among clinicians and the general public
  to better understand how accurate artificial intelligence tools must be for them to be
  used in a healthcare setting, as well as who bears the responsibility for errors that
  occurs as a result from the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare.
- The [**perspective methasynthesis**](Perspective%20metasynthesis) project aims to synthesize
  current qualitative research on the perspectives of clinicians and patients on artificial
  intelligence in primary care settings.
