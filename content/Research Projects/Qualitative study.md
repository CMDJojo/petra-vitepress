# Perceptions and Attitudes Toward AI as a Tool in Primary Care

This project investigates how healthcare professionals and patients perceive and feel about using AI, with a focus on large language models, as tools in Swedish primary care. The study aims to explore the benefits, challenges, and ethical, legal, and safety considerations associated with AI-based solutions. Data will be collected through qualitative interviews, and thematic analysis will be used to uncover key patterns and themes in the responses.

The findings are expected to provide insights into the current understanding and expectations of AI in healthcare. They will help identify potential barriers and facilitators to AI adoption, inform the design of educational materials and guidelines, and offer recommendations for policymakers, healthcare organizations, and researchers. By capturing both the hopes and concerns of those interacting with AI in primary care, the study aims to ensure that future implementations align with the needs and expectations of users.
